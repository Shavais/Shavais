     - Indie Game development in C# using low level libraries (without using any 3rd party game engine)
     - Preventing America and the world from sacrificing individual freedom and liberty on the alter of a false illusion of safety and security 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... 
     - Things I need to learn to progress on various programming projects for work and for play 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...
     - I'll alpha test your current game dev project if you'll alpha test mine (once it reaches a point where I'm giving out test keys)
     - If you'd like, I'll read and respond briefly (once or twice a week) to personal notes about your progress on your projects if you'll do the same for me
- 📫 How to reach me ...
